# EEE231 Software Engineering Group Projects

Welcome to the GitHub Organization for **EEE231 Software Engineering**! This space is dedicated to managing your group projects and maintaining comprehensive code development records for assessment purposes.

---

## Overview

This GitHub organization facilitates collaborative development and systematic record-keeping for your EEE231 coursework. You will apply software engineering principles, object-oriented programming, and team-working strategies to develop and manage large-scale software systems.

Each team must:

- Create and manage their dedicated repositories.
- Regularly commit and document code contributions.
- Maintain detailed records that support your assessment submissions (particularly Assessments 4 and 5).

---

## Repository and Permissions

- Every team will have its own repository.
- Each team member must have **admin permissions** to their own team's repository (except renaming repositories).
- Modifying repository names is not permitted without explicit instructor approval.
- Any unauthorized activities or harmful actions affecting the project or other teams' repositories will be reported and subjected to disciplinary action.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the completion of this module, you will:

1. Produce comprehensive requirements documentation for a software project.
2. Evaluate software system designs using UML (Unified Modeling Language).
3. Collaboratively deliver successful software implementations.
4. Select and justify appropriate software engineering methodologies, techniques, and tools.
5. Design and implement engineering software solutions using object-oriented programming (Python).

---

## Assessment Criteria

Repositories' documentation and commit history will serve as essential evidence for assessments, especially:

- **Assessment 4:** Software architecture, integration, testing, and maintenance documentation.
- **Assessment 5:** Final software demonstration assessing both group performance and individual contributions.

Your GitHub activity will directly influence your grades for these assessments.
